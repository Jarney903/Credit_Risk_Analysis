# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

## Analysis Results
The analysis for the six machine learning models including balanced accuracy, precision, and recall scores shows the following:

### 1 Naive Random Oversampling
![1](https://github.com/Jarney903/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig_1.jpg)
Balanced Accuracy: 0.64
Precision: High/Low risk = .01 / 1.00
Recall: High/Low risk = .70/.59

### 2 SMOTE Oversampling
![2](https://github.com/Jarney903/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig_2.jpg)
Balanced Accuracy: 0.66
Precision: High/Low risk = .01 / 1.00
Recall: High/Low risk = .63/.69

### 3 Undersampling
![3](https://github.com/Jarney903/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig_3.jpg)
Balanced Accuracy: 0.54
Precision: High/Low risk = .01 / 1.00
Recall: High/Low risk = .69/.40

### 4 Combination (over & under)
![4](https://github.com/Jarney903/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig_4.jpg)
Balanced Accuracy: 0.65
Precision: High/Low risk = .01 / 1.00
Recall: High/Low risk = .73/.57

### 5 Balanced Random Forest Classifier
![5](https://github.com/Jarney903/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig_5.jpg)
Balanced Accuracy: 0.82
Precision: High/Low risk = .04 / 1.00
Recall: High/Low risk = .75 / .90

### 6 Ensemble Classifier
![6](https://github.com/Jarney903/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig_6.jpg)
Balanced Accuracy: .93
Precision: High/Low risk = .07 / 1.00
Recall: High/Low risk = .91 / .94


## Analysis Summary
The following summary provides an analysis of the results:
    - Best Performance in Balanced Accuracy: Ensemble Classifier
    - Best Performance in Precision High Risk: All performed the same, very low
    - Best Performance in Precision Low Risk: All performed the same, very high
    - Best Performance in Recall High Risk: Ensemble Classifier
    - Best Performance in Recall Low Risk: Ensemble Classifier
Given the results from this analysis, the recomended model is Ensemble Classifier.
